# Occlusion Sensitivity as a tool for Explainability in Speech Classifiers

#### Atharva Kulkarni, Kevin Henry, Shehan Munasinghe
## Abstract

Speech and audio classification models have
demonstrated impressive performance across
traditional tasks ranging from emotion recognition, deepfake detection , language identification to general audio classification. Despite these advances, the explainability of such
systems - understanding how they make their
decisions remains a relatively under-explored
area, which impacts their transparency and
trustworthiness. In this work, we propose
a simple and lightweight occlusion-sensitivity
based approach to identify the input speech
segments that a classifier deems most important. Our approach can be easily applied to any
classifier in a model-agnostic fashion, without
the need for any additional training or finetuning, We evaluate the effectiveness of proposed approach on 3 audio classification tasks.
